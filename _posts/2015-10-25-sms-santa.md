A few weeks ago I was talking an acquaintance from Uppsala's [46elks](https://46elks.com) about documenting their telephony API for .NET developers. They sent some helpful examples and within an hour I had built my own API client and was sending messages (See: [ApiClient.cs](https://github.com/tomv564/sms-demo/blob/master/46ElksClient/ApiClient.cs))

At this point I received a call from the north pole:

**This year, Santa wants to take your gift requests via SMS.**

Not wanting to let Santa down, I got down to building and am now proud to present Santa's SMS service:

Simply send your wish to +46 76 686 1249 and Santa will confirm your request!*

<small>* Only from publicly listed Swedish mobile numbers</small>

## Implementation

### Test account

The [46elks signup](https://46elks.com) is super easy and only requires a confirmation via SMS. 46elks gives you a 20kr (~2 euro) starting credit. This is enough to rent a phone number for a month (9kr) and send around 30 messages.

### Set up a number

When you reserve a 46elks number, you can specify a HTTP callback to receive all messages on. If you reply with a 200 OK status, the response body will be sent right back to the sender!

### Handling messages

Building .NET APIs used to be fairly painful (WCF) but modern Microsoft options are much better. I decided to try a popular non-Microsoft microframework: [Nancy](http://nancyfx.org)

Set up is pretty effortless:

* Create a Console Application
* Add Nancy package from NuGet
* Add Nancy.Hosting.Self package from NuGet
* Add the following to your Main method:

{% highlight csharp %}
static void Main(string[] args) {

    var config = new HostConfiguration() {UrlReservations = new UrlReservations {CreateAutomatically = true}};
    var address = new Uri("http://localhost:8080")
    Host = new NancyHost(config, address);
    Host.Start();

    Console.WriteLine("Nancy is started and listening on {0}...", address);

    for (var line = Console.ReadLine (); line != "quit";);
    Host.Stop();
}

{% endhighlight %}

To set up handlers and routing, you simply inherit from NancyModule and register your routes in the constructor:

{% highlight csharp %}
public class SMSModule : NancyModule
{
    public SMSModule()
    {
        Post["/sms/echo"] = parameters =>
        {
            var sm = this.Bind<ShortMessage>();
            return sm.Message;
        };
        Post["/sms/gift", true] = async (ctx, token) =>
        {
            var sm = this.Bind<ShortMessage>();
            return await Santa.Reply(sm);
        };
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

Note how the echo endpoint has a regular handler, while Santa runs in an **async** handler (he's a little slow at his age).

**this.Bind** automatically maps incoming postdata to the provided model type, in this case ShortMessage:

{% highlight csharp %}
public class ShortMessage
{
    // note: matched case-insensitively to incoming postdata/json/xml parameters
    public string From { get; set; }
    public string To { get; set; }
    public string Message { get; set; }
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Santa knows all

A helpful (but creepy) discovery was that many Swedish mobile numbers can be reverse-searched using eg. [Truecaller](http://truecaller.com). This allows Santa to reply to you by name and even confirm he's coming to your town!

Understandably, TrueCaller's API is invitation-only so I resorted to scraping 118100.se instead. See the full implementation of [Santa](http://github.com/tomv564/sms-demo/blob/master/SMSServer/Santa.cs) and [the scraper](https://github.com/tomv564/sms-demo/blob/master/SwedishPersonLookup/PersonLookupClient.cs) for the gory details.

### Testing and Deployment

Testing your handler is much easier if you don't have to deploy it every time. [Ngrok](http://ngrok.com) connects your local server via an SSH tunnel to a generated public URL:

Deploying the final handler is probably easiest via one of the integrated [Nancy to Azure](https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy/wiki/Hosting-nancy-with-azure#hosting-nancy-on-azure-websites) options, but I decided to try running it [on Mono in a docker container](deploy-nancy-to-dokku.html)

### Conclusion

Building SMS integrations with an API like 46elks is feels reliable and low-effort, especially if you're already running a web app or service. Although you might be tempted to store interactions in your database, 46elk's own dashboard is pretty complete to start with.

As a .NET developer, my wishlist for the 46 elks API would be pretty short:

* A NuGet package to get a faster proof-of-concept and guidance on API usage.
* Alternatively, copy-and-pastable samples, maybe shortened by using something like [RestSharp](http://restsharp.org)
