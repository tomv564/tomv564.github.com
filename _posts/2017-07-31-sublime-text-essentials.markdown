This is my base setup before adding any language-specific tooling:

#### 1. Package Control

The package manager that should by rights be bundled with the editor. 
[Installation instructions here](https://packagecontrol.io/installation)

#### 2. SideBarTools ([github](https://github.com/braver/SideBarTools))

The most recommended package was found having [unexpected telemetry included](https://forum.sublimetext.com/t/rfc-default-package-control-channel-and-package-telemetry/30157), so I switched to SideBarTools.

The side bar is a great place to move / duplicate / delete files and folders. Still looking for a quick shortcut to exclude folders from a project.

#### 3. GitGutter ([github](https://github.com/jisaacks/GitGutter))

Classic plugin, clear visible icons in the gutter.

Configuration: (Not sold on the theme yet).
```
"theme": "Bars.gitgutter-theme",
"show_status_bar_text": false
```

#### 4. GitSavvy ([github](https://github.com/divmain/GitSavvy))

Fulfilled my wish of diffing and selective staging from while never leaving the editor.

Innovative terminal-like screens with single keystroke actions. 


#### 5. Theme: El Capitan and Oceanic Next
