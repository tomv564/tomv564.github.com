### Current mission

Help teams deliver user-friendly, well-tested and performant functionality. Contribute to quality open-source tooling. Absorb Swedish culture and gain fluency in the Swedish language!

### Background

Grew up in the Netherlands, moved to the Canadian prairies in my teens. Building software full-time from 2003 until the closing of Veer Calgary in 2011.

Took a break and completed (and enjoyed!) a Communications degree at University of Calgary.

Still holding a valid EU passport, in the summer of 2013 I dusted off my Dutch and c# to work in the Netherlands for a couple of years.

In 2015 I've moved yet again, to Uppsala in Sweden this time!

Although you won't read much about it on this blog, my other interests include speed skating, cycling and anything that combines physical activity with the outdoors.
